ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI (the creator of the initial GPT series of large language models; DALL·E 2, a diffusion model used to generate images; and Whisper, a speech transcription model).[46] The service was initially free to the public and the company had plans to monetize the service later.[47] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT had over one million users.[20] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date.[48] A March 2023 Pew Research poll found that 14% of American adults had tried ChatGPT.[49] In July, Pew Research put the same figure at 18%.[50]

No official peer-reviewed paper on ChatGPT has been published.[51] As of April 2023, ChatGPT is blocked by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Accordingly, ChatGPT geofences itself to avoid doing business in those countries.
