Although a chatbot's core function is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. Among countless examples, it can write and debug computer programs;[24] compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);[25] generate business ideas;[26] write poetry and song lyrics;[27] translate and summarize text;[28] emulate a Linux system; simulate entire chat rooms; play games like tic-tac-toe; or simulate an ATM.[22]

Compared to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses.[29] In one example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015" as truthful, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using information about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern worldâ€”including modern perceptions of Columbus's actions.
