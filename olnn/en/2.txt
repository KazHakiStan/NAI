ChatGPT is available for use online in two versions, one built on GPT-3.5 and the other on GPT-4, both of which are members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.[6] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version, while the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name "ChatGPT Plus".

ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid and unprecedented investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence.
